# 1. Image Conversion ROS 2 Package

Src contains ROS 2 packages for image processing and camera publishing.
Camera_publisher: Takes frames from your webcam via opencv and publishes on image_raw topic. On ubuntu camera sometimes dosent work try running this command in that case  "sudo usermod -aG video $USER"

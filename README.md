# ROS and BT Task

# 1. Image Conversion ROS 2 Package

1. **camera_publisher**:  
   Takes frames from your webcam via OpenCV and publishes on the `/image_raw` topic.  
   On Ubuntu, the camera sometimes doesn‚Äôt work due to permissions. Try running:  
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG video $USER
2. **Image conversion**:  
   Does the task of conversion. Service call have to be made to switch to greyscale.
   
I have made the packages using ubuntu 22.04 and ROS Humble. Kindly check for dependency issues.
